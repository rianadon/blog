# The blog of @rianadon

I've always felt like I needed a blog. Writing posts is much more enjoyable than writing documentation for me, so there's that.

I'm still in the process of theming the site and moving away from the default Jekyll look. I'd like to completely re-theme everything, but the current minima stuff isn't too bad. Maybe later.

P.S. You can view it at https://rianadon.github.io/blog
